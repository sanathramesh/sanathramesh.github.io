Hi! I'm **Sanath**, a software engineer on a journey to understand **personal finance, investing, and money management**. I started this blog to document what I’m learning and share insights that I wish I had when I began exploring finance.  

I write about topics like **investing strategies, financial planning, budgeting tips, and market trends**, all from the perspective of someone who’s learning as they go. My goal is to break down complex financial concepts into **simple, practical advice** that anyone can follow.  

If you find my content helpful, you can **support me on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/sanathrameu)** — it helps me keep exploring and writing about finance.
